# Falling Sand Simulator
A pixel-based physics and rendering engine written using C++ and OpenGL, as a part of Graphics Programming course at SNU ECE.

This project is heavily inspired by Noita and The Powder Toy.

The included video (Demo_Video.mp4) contains some flashy demo of the program. (Caution: Program not actually as exciting as the video.)
